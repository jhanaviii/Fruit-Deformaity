This TensorFlow-based deep learning model predicts fruit deformity based on images provided. The model architecture consists of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling to extract features from input images, with dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The final layer uses a sigmoid activation function for binary classification (normal or deformed). The dataset used includes images of fruits categorized into normal and deformed classes. During training, the model achieved high accuracy on both training and validation datasets. This model can be utilized for quality control in fruit production to identify and classify deformed fruits early in the production process.
